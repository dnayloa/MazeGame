# MazeGame

This is project designed to develop my skills in Java.

The game will start as a simple maze game where the player must solve a series of mazes.

## Future Goals
       * Randomly generate the mazes
       * Possible survival mode with infinite mazes
       * Implement mods for the player to fight in the maze
       * Implement multiplayer for two players to run the maze togther
